[Unit 1 Lesson 8 "Color images"] (https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2023/lessons/8/levels/4/)

### To use:
You can use this script to generate an image in bits and then paste the BinaryOutput.txt

Download `PILPixels.py`, change or add to the `Pics` variable the image file path, and then put the index of that element in `line 35` and hit run!
